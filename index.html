    <section class="main-content">
      <p>Ma.Moose is a project born at Politecnico di Torino in 2015.
It is a sub part of a bigger project called Arduino Disability Orchestra, which you can check out at this link: <a href="https://arduinodisabilityorchestra.wordpress.com/">https://arduinodisabilityorchestra.wordpress.com/</a>.</p>

<p>The main goal of the project was to create musical instruments via Bare Conductive touchboards in order to give disable kids the possibility to form a true Orchestra.
Ma.Moose, at the moment, is a glove which, when touches any kind of surface, reproduces a sound.
The first prototype we made reproduced notes of a cello but, theoretically, it can reproduce any kind of sound.</p>

<p>Our idea was to implement a second glove equipped with an accelerometer which would give the performer the ability to module the sound as he wanted.
We ran into some memory problem when we started working on this part so we decide to leave it for later.</p>

<p>Then the school year ended, everyone got home from university and I left for China.
To my knowledge development of the gloves has ended or, at least, it is not going on but I plan to take back this project and try my best to complete it as soon as I go back to Politecnico and to Turin's Fablab.</p>

<p>Meanwhile feel free to work on it and do whatever you want. If you ever need some more information or you want some more explanations don't esitate in contacting me via email or on Twitter.</p>

<p>Farewell!</p>
